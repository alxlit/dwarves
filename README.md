# Dwarves

This is my [L2Ork](http://l2ork.music.vt.edu/main/) composition.

It's sort of a narrative piece inspired by dwarves in popular culture (I had seen The Hobbit (Part 2) around the start of the semester, and was also fiddling with Dwarf Fortress in my spare time).
Since I don't have much formal musical training, I found it easier to get together a bunch of sounds and put them together.
I used [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io) to compose the piece and [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) and LaTeX to generate the score, which you can see [here](https://github.com/alxlit/dwarves/master/score.pdf).

Most of the sounds are from [Freesound](http://freesound.org/).
There are two samples from The Hobbit (joviality-1) and The Lord of the Rings (joviality-0), as well as a sample of the Dwarf Fortress main theme (theme-0) by Tarn Adams.
I believe that these fall under *fair use*, since L2Ork is nonprofit and purely for education/research.
See [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](http://github.com/alxlit/dwarves/master/ATTRIBUTIONS.md) for the full list of sources.
