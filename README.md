# Dwarves

This is my [L2Ork](http://l2ork.music.vt.edu/main/) composition, for seven players using an instrument written in [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/).

It's sort of a narrative piece inspired by dwarves in popular culture (I had seen The Hobbit around the start of the semester, and had also been fiddling with Dwarf Fortress a little).
I don't have much formal musical training, and I found it easier to get together a bunch of sounds and smoosh them together.
I think it turned out alright.
The process was more interesting to me.
I used [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io) to compose the piece and [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) and LaTeX to generate the score, which you can view [here](https://github.com/alxlit/dwarves/blob/master/score.pdf?raw=true).

Most of the sounds are from [Freesound](http://freesound.org/).
There are two samples from The Hobbit (joviality-1) and The Lord of the Rings (joviality-0), as well as a sample of the Dwarf Fortress main theme (theme-0) by Tarn Adam.
I believe these fall under "fair use," since L2Ork is nonprofit and purely for education/research.

I also used Joseph Wilk's [overtone.orchestra](https://github.com/josephwilk/overtone.orchestra) and adapted his [sampled-flute-vibrato](http://blog.josephwilk.net/clojure/creating-instruments-with-overtone.html) (not in the final version).
